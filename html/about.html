            <h2>Thomas Baeskow - Founder BAE-FLIX</h2>
            <h3>former Key Account Manager - now Software engineer based in Berlin germany</h3>
            <p>I developed BAE-FLIX in connection with my first UIB Basics project. BAE-FLIX is about my personal movie taste. My favorite movies are divided into different genres. If you have other movie suggestions, feel free to tell me! </p>
            <p>The project is still under construction. Optionally, I add another html file, where I include my personal description and interpretation, as well as my evaluation of the movies.</p>
